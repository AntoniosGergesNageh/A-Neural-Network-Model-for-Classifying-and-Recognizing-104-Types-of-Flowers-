# A-Neural-Network-Model-for-Classifying-and-Recognizing-104-Types-of-Flowers
Imagine a smart system that can look at pictures of flowers and tell you exactly what type of flower it is, even if it's a rare one! Our project is like a digital flower expert, and it's all thanks to something called a Neural Network.

You know how you can recognize a friend's face in a photo? Well, our Neural Network does something similar, but with flowers. We have this huge collection of flower pictures called the Petals to Metals dataset. It's like a big photo album with images of 104 different types of flowers.

Now, here's the cool part - we're teaching our computer to recognize each flower from these pictures. It's like training a pet to learn tricks, but in this case, our "pet" is a super smart computer program.

Some flowers are really specific, like a pink primrose, while others have many variations. Our computer is learning to tell the difference between all of them by looking at their petals, colors, and shapes. It's like giving our computer super eyes that can see the unique features of each flower.

So, when you show our system a flower picture, it looks at the details and says, "Ah, that's a tulip!" or "Hey, that's a daffodil!" It's like having a virtual flower expert right at your fingertips, all thanks to the power of Neural Networks and our special Petals to Metals dataset.

In a nutshell, our project is like having a digital flower encyclopedia that can identify 104 types of flowers just by looking at their pictures. How cool is that?

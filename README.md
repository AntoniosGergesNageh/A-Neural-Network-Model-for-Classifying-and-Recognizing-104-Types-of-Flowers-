# A-Neural-Network-Model-for-Classifying-and-Recognizing-104-Types-of-Flowers

## Flower Recognition at Your Fingertips üå∏

Welcome to our Petals to Metals project! This Neural Network is your digital flower expert, capable of classifying 104 types of flowers just by looking at their pictures.

### What is Petals to Metals?

Petals to Metals is a collection of images from various flower species. Each image is labeled with its corresponding flower class, making it a diverse dataset for accurate flower classification.

### How It Works

Our Neural Network acts like a virtual flower expert, learning to recognize flowers based on their unique features. It's trained on the Petals to Metals dataset, studying details like petals, colors, and shapes.

Some flowers are very specific, like pink primroses, while others have many variations. The computer learns to tell the difference, becoming a digital encyclopedia for identifying 104 types of flowers.

### Usage

Simply show the system a flower picture, and it'll identify the flower type, whether it's a tulip or a daffodil. It's like having a virtual flower expert at your fingertips!

Explore the world of flowers effortlessly with our Neural Network.
